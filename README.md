# Tech_layoff_Analysis
Introduction:
This analysis aims to explore trends and patterns in tech layoffs using a dataset obtained from sources tracking layoffs within the tech industry. The dataset includes information such as company names, total layoffs, impacted workforce percentage, reported dates, industry, headquarters location, and additional notes. The analysis employs R programming along with libraries such as ggplot2, dplyr, and forecast for data manipulation, visualization, and forecasting.

Data Preparation:

The dataset was imported from a CSV file and examined using the View() and summary() functions to understand its structure and summary statistics.
Columns with character values, such as 'total_layoffs', 'impacted_workforce_percentage', and 'reported_date', were converted to numeric and date formats where necessary.
Unclear or null values were identified and replaced with NA for further analysis.
Missing values were handled by replacing them with the mean values of their respective columns to maintain data integrity.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

The analysis began by examining unique values in each column to identify any inconsistencies or patterns.
The frequency of headquarters locations and layoff industries was visualized using pie charts to identify majority categories.
Trends in layoffs over time were analyzed by grouping the data by year and month, and the total number of layoffs was plotted against time.
Seasonal patterns in layoffs were identified using boxplots to observe variations across different months.
Industry Analysis:

The absolute number and percentage of impacted workforce were calculated for each company within repeated industries.
The percentage of impacted workforce by industry was visualized using a bar plot to identify industries with the highest impact.
Correlation Analysis:

A correlation matrix was computed to explore relationships between total layoffs, impacted workforce percentage, and total workforce.
The correlation analysis provided insights into how these variables are related to each other within the dataset.
Time Series Forecasting:

A time series object was created using the total layoffs data, and an ARIMA model was fitted to the time series data.
Future layoffs were forecasted for the next 12 periods, and the forecast results were visualized to illustrate potential trends.
Conclusion:
This analysis offers valuable insights into tech layoffs trends and patterns, providing stakeholders with a better understanding of the dynamics within the tech industry. The findings can inform decision-making processes related to workforce management, resource allocation, and strategic planning in tech companies. Further analysis and interpretation of the results can lead to actionable recommendations for mitigating the impact of layoffs and promoting sustainable growth within the industry.
